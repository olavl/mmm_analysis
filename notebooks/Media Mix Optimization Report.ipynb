    "# Media Mix Optimization Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Our media mix modeling analysis reveals significant opportunities to improve marketing efficiency. The current media budget allocation (\\$50,375 monthly) is vastly overallocated across all channels, with each operating well beyond their optimal efficiency points. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "- **All channels are currently operating in unprofitable regions**, with spend levels exceeding their ROI=1 breakeven points\n",
    "- **Maximum ROI opportunity**: By reducing total budget to \\$20,150 (40% of current) and reallocating across channels, we could increase ROI from 3.11 to 6.63 (+113%)\n",
    "- **Maximum sales opportunity**: By maintaining current budget but optimizing allocation, we could increase sales impact by 18.6%\n",
    "- **Digital and TV** are our most effective channels, though both are significantly overfunded\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Recommendations:**\n",
    "1. Implement a strategic budget reallocation to align with each channel's unique response curve\n",
    "2. Reduce TV spend by 64% and Radio spend by 98% regardless of strategic approach\n",
    "3. Digital should remain the highest-funded channel under any scenario\n",
    "4. Choose either the ROI-maximizing approach (higher efficiency) or sales-maximizing approach (higher volume) based on current business priorities\n",
    "5. Continuously monitor and adjust as campaign effects and competitive dynamics evolve\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Our Marketing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Our media mix model (MMM) captures three critical aspects of marketing effectiveness:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base sales vs. incremental impact**: How much of our sales would occur without advertising\n",
    "2. **Carryover effects**: How long the impact of each channel persists over time\n",
    "3. **Diminishing returns**: How efficiency declines as spending increases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Marketing Dynamics Revealed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Media Spend Trends (2017-2021)\n",
    "![Media Spend by Channel Over Time](./image1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Digital spend** has grown steadily, overtaking TV in late 2020\n",
    "- **TV spend** has fluctuated with occasional spikes\n",
    "- **Radio and Print** remain relatively stable at lower levels\n",
    "- The current monthly allocation is approximately: TV (\\$22,219), Digital (\\$20,010), Radio (\\$5,314), and Print (\\$2,832)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### External Factors Impacting Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis identified several non-media factors that significantly influence sales:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Average Sales by Seasonal Event](./image2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seasonal events** drive substantial sales variation, with Christmas generating the highest average (\\$155,200)\n",
    "- Halloween, Easter, and Thanksgiving also create notable sales increases\n",
    "\n",
    "![Average Sales by Economic Condition](./image3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Economic conditions** significantly affect baseline sales performance\n",
    "- Growth periods show a 7.9% increase over sales during economic decline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Channel Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Carryover Effects (Adstock Modeling)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Adstock Patterns by Channel](./image4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis reveals distinct carryover patterns across channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TV** shows moderate persistence (decay rate = 0.60), with effects lasting several months\n",
    "- **Digital** demonstrates rapid decay (0.20), with minimal impact beyond the first month\n",
    "- **Print** has the strongest persistence (0.80), creating substantial long-term impact\n",
    "- **Radio** shows moderate carryover (0.50)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Impact of \\$1000 Pulse Spend](./image6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns translate to different total sales effects over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A \\$1000 TV campaign eventually generates \\$1,710 in sales (2.5x multiplier)\n",
    "- A \\$1000 Digital campaign quickly generates \\$1,729 in sales (1.25x multiplier)\n",
    "- A \\$1000 Print campaign slowly delivers \\$2,875 in sales (5.0x multiplier)\n",
    "- A \\$1000 Radio campaign has a mixed effect pattern with a 2.0x multiplier\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diminishing Returns Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diminishing Returns Evidence](./image7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All channels show clear evidence of diminishing returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Digital** shows the most consistent diminishing returns pattern\n",
    "- **TV** demonstrates steep initial drop-off, then flattens at higher spend levels\n",
    "- **Radio** shows pronounced efficiency drops at relatively low spend levels\n",
    "- **Print** exhibits the steepest initial drop in response per dollar\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hill Transformation parameters (Image 8) quantify these patterns, with lower gamma values indicating stronger diminishing returns effects:\n",
    "- TV: gamma = 0.6999\n",
    "- Digital: gamma = 0.6991\n",
    "- Radio: gamma = 0.7000\n",
    "- Print: gamma = 0.8000\n",
    "\n",
    "## Channel Response Curves: The Key to Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model generates precise response curves showing how each channel's impact changes with spending:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Channel Response Curves](./image13.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These curves reveal critical insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Every channel is currently operating beyond its optimal efficiency point** (where the curve intersects the ROI=1 line)\n",
    "- TV's current spend (\\$22,219) far exceeds its optimal point (\\$3,826)\n",
    "- Digital's current spend (\\$20,010) is well above its breakeven point (\\$6,054)\n",
    "- Radio and Print are also operating beyond their respective ROI=1 thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "![Elasticity Comparison](./image14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The elasticity analysis confirms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All channels show declining elasticity as spend increases\n",
    "- At current spend levels, TV maintains slightly higher elasticity (0.39) than other channels\n",
    "- Print and Radio demonstrate higher elasticity at lower spend levels\n",
    "- All channels fall into the \"Fair Returns\" category at current spend levels\n",
    "\n",
    "## Budget Optimization Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis presents two strategic options with different objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ROI vs Sales Tradeoff](./image15.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 1: Maximize ROI (Efficiency Focus)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach prioritizes marketing efficiency by operating at each channel's most effective spending level:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Budget**: \\$20,150 (40% of current)\n",
    "- **Projected Impact**: \\$133,648 (-14.8% vs. current)\n",
    "- **ROI**: 6.63 (+113.1% vs. current)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Channel Allocation:**\n",
    "- TV: \\$7,968 (-64.1%)\n",
    "- Digital: \\$10,996 (-45.0%)\n",
    "- Radio: \\$100 (-98.1%)\n",
    "- Print: \\$1,086 (-61.7%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy 2: Maximize Sales (Volume Focus)\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach uses the full budget but optimizes allocation to maximize total sales:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Budget**: \\$50,375 (unchanged)\n",
    "- **Projected Impact**: \\$186,012 (+18.6% vs. current)\n",
    "- **ROI**: 3.69 (+18.6% vs. current)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Channel Allocation:**\n",
    "- TV: \\$23,377 (+5.2%)\n",
    "- Digital: \\$22,535 (+12.6%)\n",
    "- Radio: \\$0 (-100%)\n",
    "- Print: \\$4,463 (+57.6%)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Budget Allocation Comparison](./image16.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations and Implementation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our comprehensive analysis, we recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a strategic approach** based on current business priorities:\n",
    "   - If efficiency and profitability are primary concerns: Implement the ROI Maximization strategy\n",
    "   - If market share and sales volume are primary concerns: Implement the Sales Maximization strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement a phased reallocation**:\n",
    "   - Month 1-2: Test reduced TV and Radio budgets in select markets\n",
    "   - Month 3-4: Roll out full reallocation if test results confirm model predictions\n",
    "   - Month 5-6: Fine-tune allocations based on performance data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhance measurement protocols**:\n",
    "   - Implement more granular tracking of Digital sub-channels\n",
    "   - Establish campaign-specific tracking codes\n",
    "   - Create regular reporting to monitor performance against predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Develop contingency plans**:\n",
    "   - Identify opportunities for rapid budget adjustment if market conditions change\n",
    "   - Create standardized processes for evaluating new promotional opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Appendix\n",
    "\n",
    "The full modeling approach included:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adstock transformation** to capture carryover effects across time periods\n",

    "3. **Ridge regression** with cross-validation to handle correlation between channels\n",
    "4. **Time series cross-validation** to ensure robust parameter estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete model (Image 12) achieved:\n",
    "- R² = 0.7319\n",
    "- RMSE = \\$7,860.67\n",
    "- MAPE = 4.26%\n",
    "\n",
    "This model successfully captures:\n",
    "- Trend effects (time_index coefficient = 100.30)\n",
    "- Economic conditions (Econ_State coefficient = 3761.43)\n",
    "- Seasonal events (Christmas effect = 14564.17)\n",
    "- Media channel effects (TV, Digital, Radio, Print coefficients)\n",
    "\n",
    "The model provides a robust foundation for marketing decisions, though ongoing monitoring and refinement are recommended to adapt to changing market conditions."
